Using the Application:

Add Account: Enter the account number, name, and balance, then click the "Add Account" button to add the account to the database.
View Accounts: Click the "View Accounts" button to display all the accounts stored in the database.
Delete Account: Select an account from the listbox and click the "Delete Account" button to remove the selected account from the database.
This code should work without any errors and give you a basic but functional bank management desktop application.
